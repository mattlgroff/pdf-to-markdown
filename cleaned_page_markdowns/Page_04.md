## 3. Critical Sites

Critical sites are those habitats that may have a key role for the conservation status of a shark population, and may include feeding, mating, pupping, overwintering grounds and other aggregation sites, as well as corridors between these sites such as migration routes. Critical subadult and adult aggregation sites are often associated with pinniped colonies, including locations along the central California coast; Guadalupe Island, Mexico; South Africa, South Australia, off the east coast of New Zealand, and Massachusetts. Overwintering grounds have been identified in coastal and offshore subtropical waters. Potential nursery and juvenile aggregation areas have been identified off southern California and Baja California, eastern Australia, and the New York Bight.

## 4. Population Status and Trends

There are no stock assessments for White Shark. However, there are estimates of population sizes from South Africa, California, and Australia with varying levels of uncertainty and information on population trends are available for some populations and areas. The current IUCN Red List status for the global population of White Sharks is 'Vulnerable'. More details of the population status and trends can be found in the IUCN assessment.

## 5. Threats

- Fisheries: The majority of annual captures is assumed to occur incidentally in commercial fisheries operating longlines, setlines, gillnets, trawls, fish-traps and other gear. Great White Sharks are caught in recreational fisheries and shark culling.
- International trade: White Sharks fins of various sizes are illegally traded, indicating their utilization as both, food and trophies.

- Habitat degradation: The degradation caused by coastal development, pollution, and prey depletion in inshore habitats utilized by White Sharks might have negative impacts on the health, range, and abundance of White Sharks.

- Shark meshing (bather protection): Bather protection nets or Shark Meshing is used to protect humans on some popular coastal areas from shark attacks. Drum lining (Australia) and protective nets (Australia and South Africa) do result in shark mortality, but the impact on White shark populations is uncertain.

- Data is needed on population estimates and trends.
