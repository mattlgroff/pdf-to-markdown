## 3. Critical Sites

Critical sites are those habitats that may have a key role for the conservation status of a shark population, and may include feeding, mating, pupping, overwintering grounds and other aggregation sites, as well as corridors between these sites such as migration routes. Critical subadult and adult aggregation sites are often associated with pinniped colonies, including locations along the central California coast (Klimley 1985; Weng et al. 2007; Jorgensen et al. 2009); Guadalupe Island, Mexico (Domeier and Nasby-Lucas 2007; 2008); South Africa (Dudley 2012; Kock et al. 2013), South Australia (Bruce 1992; Bruce et al. 2018), off the east coast of New Zealand (Duffy et al. 2012), and Massachusetts (Skomal et al. 2012; 2017). Overwintering grounds have been identified in coastal and offshore subtropical waters (Weng et al. 2007; Domeier and Nasby-Lucas 2008; Duffy et al. 2012; Curtis et al. 2014). Potential nursery and juvenile aggregation areas have been identified off southern California and Baja California (Lowe et al. 2012; Onate-Gonzalez et al. 2017), eastern Australia (Bruce and Bradford 2012), and the New York Bight (Casey and Pratt 1985; Curtis et al. 2018).

## 4. Population Status and Trends

There are no stock assessments for White Shark. However, there are estimates of population sizes from South Africa, California, and Australia with varying levels of uncertainty (Chapple et al. 2011; Dewar et al. 2013; Burgess et al. 2014; Andreotti et al. 2016; Iron et al. 2017; Bruce et al. 2018; Hillary et al. 2018) and information on population trends are available for some populations and areas. The current IUCN Red List status for the global population of White Sharks is 'Vulnerable' (Fergusson et al. 2009). More details of the population status and trends can be found in the IUCN assessmentii.

## 5. Threats

- Fisheries: The majority of annual captures is assumed to occur incidentally in commercial fisheries operating longlines, setlines, gillnets, trawls, fish-traps and other gear. Great White Sharks are caught in recreational fisheries and shark culling (Compagno 2001; Fergusson et al. 2009).
- International trade: Shivji et al. (2005) demonstrated that White Sharks fins of various sizes are illegally traded, indicating their utilization as both, food and trophies.

- Habitat degradation: The degradation caused by coastal development, pollution, and prey depletion in inshore habitats utilized by White Sharks might have negative impacts on the health, range, and abundance of White Sharks (Fergusson et al. 2009).

- Shark meshing (bather protection): Bather protection nets or Shark Meshing is used to protect humans on some popular coastal areas from shark attacks. Drum lining (Australia) and protective nets (Australia and South Africa) do result in shark mortality, but the impact on White shark populations is uncertain (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006; Reid et al. 2011).

- Data is needed on population estimates and trends.
