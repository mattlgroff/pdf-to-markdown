## 6. Key Knowledge Gaps

- Data is needed on population estimates and trends;
- Estimates of total discards and post-release mortality rates across fisheries and regions;
- Better understanding of reproductive biology and productivity;
- Understanding the potential impacts of protective beach meshing and drum line programs.

## 7. Key Management and Conservation Gaps

- Critical habitats in some regions have not been identified and delineated;
- Catch monitoring and reporting;
- Ecological impacts of ecotourism activities;
- Population dynamics modeling of the effects of protective beach meshing and drum line programs.

## 8. Suggestions for Conservation and Management Action

### a) Incorporate conservation measures for White Sharks into national legislation of all Parties/Signatories (in compliance with the obligations of the for the Appendix I listed species of CMS^ii and line with the objectives of the Sharks MOU)
- Evaluate and revise the current implementation/compliance with CITES^iv Appendix I and CMS Appendix I obligations.

### b) Improve the understanding of White Sharks through strategic research, monitoring and information exchange
- Identify new White Shark critical sites;
- Focus on key habitats and oceanic movements for future research to support development of spatial fisheries management;
- Undertake genetic studies to determine population structures and effective population sizes;
- Undertake research to better quantify the potential impacts of protective beach meshing and drum line programs on White Shark populations, and mitigate those impacts if necessary;
- Share research results and expertise with other stakeholders/Range States/Sharks MOU Secretariat.
