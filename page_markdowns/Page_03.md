## 1. Biology

The Great White Shark or White Shark (_Carcharodon carcharias_) inhabits coastal and offshore pelagic waters of subtropical and temperate seas. Great White Shark has low fecundity (2-17 pups per female every other year; Bruce 2008), and females attain sexual maturity at a late age (33 years) and size (4.5 m). Based on bomb radio-carbon signatures, the maximum age of White sharks is up to 73 years (Hamady et al. 2014).

## 2. Distribution

The White Shark is distributed throughout all oceans, with seasonal concentrations in temperate coastal areas (Compagno 2001), including California, USA to Baja California, Mexico (Ainley et al. 1985; Klimley 1985; Domeier and Nasby-Lucas 2007; Lowe et al. 2012; OÃ±ate-Gonzalez et al. 2017), the Northwest Atlantic (Casey and Pratt 1985; Curtis et al. 2014), Australia (Bruce 1992; Bruce and Bradford 2012; McAuley et al. 2017), and South Africa (Ferreira and Ferreira 1996; Dudley 2012). The Mediterranean Sea is thought to host a fairly isolated population with little or no contemporary immigration from the Atlantic (Gubili et al. 2010).

Additionally, there is a seasonal offshore aggregation region in the subtropical Northeastern Pacific (Weng et al. 2007; Domeier and Nasby-Lucas 2008; Jorgensen et al. 2009).
